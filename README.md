## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox

### What I learned

Nothing out of the ordinary, really. This was mostly another challenge to consolidate what I already know with Flexbox and seeing how quickly I could finish the challenge (which turns out, was under an hour!)

### Continued development

Still practice, really - this did become a little messy for no apparent reason because of how much I was using align-self, but for a quick mockup with Flexbox I think I did a decent job. Hoping to complete the newbie directory on challenges and then start looking into Javascript challenges. Really enjoying mucking around with hover states.
